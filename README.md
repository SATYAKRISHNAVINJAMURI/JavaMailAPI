# JavaMailAPI

All the implementation for reading the files is done in the ReadInbox.java and Testing is done for it in TestReadInbox.

Here everything is maven Configured and one can change the values at config.properties files in src/main/resources
and src/test/resources.

It contains fields like USER_NAME
PASSWORD 
and many more. Change only those values which you think are necessary for a program.

For example to send email only RECIPIENTS ,USER_NAME, PASSWORD has to be changed.
